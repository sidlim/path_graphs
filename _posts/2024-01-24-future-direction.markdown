	<h1> UI </h1>
	<p> TypeDB Studio as a front-end for Path Graphs leaves much to be desired. As can be seen in the illustrations on the poster, TypeDB Studio generates much visual clutter for simple pathway searches. The next steps for Path Graphs include putting together a web application that will simplify the output of a database search. It will also increase portability, allowing Pathology Graphs to be run on the go on devices like smartphones. </p>
	<h1> Data Input </h1>
	<p> Currently, data input for Pathology Graphs is done by writing code for each object and relationship to be represented. A next step for Pathology Graphs includes exploring automation for database population. Other routes may also include building Pathology Graphs as a notes style application, where students build their own graphs on a tablet as they learn. </p>
	<h1> Database Use </h1>
	<p> TypeDB as a back-end also comes with its own limitations. Mutliple inheritance is not supported, and after surveying technologies used to build a typed database, it appears possible to write a simple typed database that supports constructs like multiple inheritance and metaprogramming. This may be a next step for Pathology Graphs. </p>
